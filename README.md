Rendezvous
==========

This project desperately needs to be redone, as it was originally made at MHacks Fall 2014 (with subpar coding quality) and used client-side JavaScript for all API calls and data processing. The end goal, if I become sufficiently adept with Clojure in a reasonable amount of time, is to make this project using a Clojure backend on a PaaS such as Heroku.
